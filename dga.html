        <h1>Pixel Project</h1>

        <h2> Why choose pixel as a medium for an artwork? </h2>
        <p>Using Pixel offers a unique mix of creativity and challenge — it's engaging, occasionally frustrating, and ultimately rewarding. <i>Of course, it's also a requirement set by the lecturer.</i></p>

            <h2>The Process</h2>
            <div class="processGrid">
                <div class="card">
                <p>
                    It started as a simple idea to create a cute character that will be whimsical and satisfy my fascination with cute fluffy things. 
                    After searching the internet for a suitable mascot for this project, I stumbled across a furry friend, Spank. 
                    This then later inspired me to create the pixel character that has been submitted.

                <div class="card">
                    <p>After choosing the reference, I then selected the software that would help me create my desired character, which turned out to be Piskel for its benefits and ease of use.</p>
                    <div class="subCard">
                    <p><i>Side note: Piskel is an easy software that is free, doesn’t require downloads, and doesn’t demand previous knowledge of pixel characters or development.</i></p>
                    </div>
                </div>

        <p>The process of creating the characters and the different pannels have taken much longer than I have anticipated, not even mentioning the technical difficulties that have popped up along the way, yet after the help of AI tools and of our dear lecturer, I was finally able to create my cute cat.</p>

        <h2>Post Process</h2>
        <p> Following the production of the pixel character, I have extracted the sprite sheet and placed it in unity so that I finalize the chracater and make Spank look like he really is a part of a video game. <i>Giving him, his much desired main character moment</i></p>
        <i>Spank really felt like a start while being shown off.</i>

        <h2>Problems along the way...</h2>
        <p> Some problems that i've encountered along the way were:</p>
            <ul> 
                <li>being unable to create the poses without looking for references</li>
                <li>storage problems</li>
                <li>problems with unity</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Solutions to the problems</h2>
        <p> Asking for help from experienced people as well as not shying from looking up tutorials and other useful informtaion online</p>


        <h2>Suggestions for future projects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>If I were to create the sprite sheet again, in a more leasure timeframe trhen I would pay more attention to the details and to the diffrenbt poses like the idel and the jump.
            Those two poses, im my opinion rewuire a bit more work and refimement. </li>
            <li>Another thing that I would keep im mind is striving to create a sprite sheet in less fmames than I did.</li>
            <li>I would also like to experiment with diffrent tools that i have not used in piskel web.</li>
            <li>Definetly not draw the character in 180x180, althought this gave me more details, because of this it took me way more time than it should have.</li>
            <li>And finally, explore unity and its tools.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Final outcome satisfaction</h2>
        <p>Overall, I a pretty satisfied with how my Spank turned out, just the right level of chubbiness, cutness and playfulness. I enjoy how everything came together at the end and made my 2D character have some personality and dimention.</p>
